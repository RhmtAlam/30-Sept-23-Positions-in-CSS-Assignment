    <h1>What Is Absolute Positioning?</h1>
    <p>You may position your element exactly where you want it with absolute positioning.  The initial parent element that is positioned relatively (or absolutely) serves as the reference point for absolute positioning. The element with absolute position will be positioned in relation to the HTML element (the page itself) if there is no positioned parent element. Making ensuring absolute positioning is not misused is a crucial consideration because doing so can result in a maintenance nightmare. The following step is to demonstrate an instance of absolute placement. The parent element's position in the example is set to relative. Any further positioning will now be done relative to the parent element if the child element's position is set to absolute. The child element shifts relative to the parent element to the right by 40px and to the top by 100

    <h1>What Is Relative Positioning?</h1>
    <p>Without adding any additional positioning properties (top, bottom, right, or left), nothing will happen when you set the position relative to an element. When you add a position other than relative, like left: 20px, the element will shift 20px to the right of where it normally is. You can see that this element is related to itself in this instance. No other element on the layout will be impacted by the element's movement. Relative to an element restricts the range of absolutely positioned child components, thus keep that in mind while setting position. This implies that any element that is a child of this element may be positioned in this block in an absolute manner. We must provide evidence to support this brief explanation by giving an example. You can see how the relative positioned element changes as its attributes are updated in this example. As a result of no changes to the additional positioning characteristics, the first element shifts from its default position to the left and top while the second element remains in the same spot.
